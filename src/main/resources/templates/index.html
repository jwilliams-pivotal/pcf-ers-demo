				<p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate some basic
					capabilities of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform, in particular
					the Pivotal Elastic Runtime Service which is the core component
					responsible for running the application workloads as containers.</p>
				<h3>Application Components and Architecture</h3>
				<p>Currently the application is one deployment with the UI and
					backend packaged inside the same artifact - Spring Boot jar.
					However, logically the UI/client is completely separate from the
					backend services.</p>
